# Restaurant Menu Management System!
The "Restaurant Menu Management System" is a console-based Java application designed to manage the menu and order processing for a restaurant. The project aims to provide a structured interface for customers to choose from different menu categories, such as soups, biryanis, starters, family packs, and kebabs. Customers can select items, specify quantities, and calculate the total bill in a simple, interactive manner. This project demonstrates an understanding of Java programming concepts like loops, conditionals, switches, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations. It is a useful tool for simulating a restaurant ordering system, providing a hands-on experience in software development for point-of-sale (POS) systems.
